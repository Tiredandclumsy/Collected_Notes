Covariance is a measure of spread and correlation between two dimensions of data.
$$C = \cfrac 1 {N} \sum _i (v_i - \mu)^T (v_i - \mu)$$
 
where $\mu$ is the array of means of values in the $n$th dimension
The covariance of any dimension taken with itself is its variance.

Note that $N$ is replaced by $N-1$ when the population mean is not known, and the sample mean is taken instead.

# Covariance matrix
A matrix can be generated by the covariances between each dimension in a data set. for two dimensions this matrix is given by $$C = \cfrac 1 N \sum _i \begin{bmatrix} (v_{i,1} - \mu_1)^2 & (v_{i,1} - \mu_1)(v_{i,2} - \mu_2) \\ (v_{i,1} - \mu_1)(v_{1,2}\mu_2) & (v_{1,2}\mu_2)^2 \end{bmatrix}$$
This matrix encodes specific properties of the data:
- $\begin{pmatrix} + & + \\ + & +\end{pmatrix}$: positive correlation
- $\begin{pmatrix} + & - \\ - & +\end{pmatrix}$: negative correlation
- $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & +\end{pmatrix}$: vertical line
- $\begin{pmatrix} + & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$: horizontal line
- $\begin{pmatrix} + & 0 \\ 0 & +\end{pmatrix}$: positive and negative correlation (X-shape)
