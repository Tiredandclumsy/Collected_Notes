Bandwidth refers to the size of the range of frequencies a transmitted signal is permitted to contain in a [[Communication system|communication system]]. 
Often, the case is not just that the channel will only permit certain frequencies to pass through it, but also that the designers of the communication system are only permitted to use a certain subset of those frequencies.
For example, radio waves only propagate usefully through the atmosphere in a given frequency range, but his range is broken up into licenses that must be bought so that multiple services can use the spectrum without interference.

A higher bandwidth permits a higher maximum symbol rate, which in turn permits a higher maximum bit rate. All optimally designed communication systems are therefore bandwidth limited.

# Bandwidth efficiency
The bandwidth efficiency of a communication system is a measure of how optimally the system uses the available bandwidth of the channel. 
It is evaluated as the [[Rates of communication#Data rate|data rate]] per unit bandwidth $\eta_B = \cfrac{f_d}{B}$, in units of $\text{bits/s/Hz}$.
