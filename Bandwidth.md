Bandwidth refers to the size of the range of frequencies a transmitted signal is permitted to contain in a [[Communication system|communication system]]. 

A higher bandwidth permits a higher maximum symbol rate, which in turn permits a higher maximum bit rate. All optimally designed communication systems are therefore bandwidth limited.
