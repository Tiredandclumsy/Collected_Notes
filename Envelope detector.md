An envelope detector takes an input [[signal]], and outputs the envelope - the low frequency curve outlining the peaks of a high frequency signal. 

The circuitry of an envelope generator is a half-wave rectifier and a low-pass filter (often an RC filter). 

An envelope detector can be used to [[Demodulation|demodulate]] a low-frequency signal encoded via [[Modulation#Carrier modulation|carrier modulation]].
