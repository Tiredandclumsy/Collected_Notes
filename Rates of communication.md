# Symbol rate
The symbol rate of a [[Communication system]] refers to the rate of change of symbol states on a channel. Put simply, it is the number of symbols transmitted per unit time.
Symbol rate is usually measured in symbols per second, also called Baud, and is denoted $f_s$. 

The reciprocal of the symbol rate is the symbol period $T_s$


# Data rate
The data rate (or information transfer rate) is defined as the number of bits transmitted per unit time.
It is usually measured in bits per second, and is denoted $f_d$.

Data rate is given from symbol rate: $f_d = f_s \times \log_2 M$ where $M$ is the number of symbols used in the communications system.
