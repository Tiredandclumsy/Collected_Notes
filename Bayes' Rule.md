Bayes' rule states that $$P(B|A) = P(A|B) \frac{P(B)}{P(A)}$$It is useful when considering $A$ as the evidence of an event, and $B$ the event itself, since it allows the derivation of how likely the evidence is correct knowing only how reliable it is. 

# Terminology
The posterior $P(B|A)$: The probability of event given evidence
The prior $P(B)$: The probability of the event occurring
The likelihood $P(A|B)$: The probability that evidence is seen given the event
