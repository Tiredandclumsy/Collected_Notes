The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theory states that any signal with a highest frequency component at $u \text{Hz}$ must be sampled with a rate higher than $2u\text{Hz}$ in order for the complete signal to be recoverable from the sample. 
$2u$ is often referred to as the Nyquist frequency.

Any errors formed by sampling at a lower rate than the Nyquist frequency are collectively called aliasing.

Aliasing can occur in images if the theorem is not met. However, in this case, the theorem must hold for the maximum frequency component of the functions of each colour varying in both the x and y dimensions.
