A comparitor is an electronic circuit that outputs $0V$ if given an input signal lower than a certain threshold, and some high value $+V$ when the input signal meets or exceeds the threshold value.

They are very commonly used in binary [[Demodulation|demodulators]] to reverse the effects of [[bandpass filtering]] smoothing the discrete levels of the original binary message.

# Multi-input comparitor
Another type of comparitor takes $n$ inputs, outputting one of $n$ discrete voltage levels dependent on which input has the highest voltage.
