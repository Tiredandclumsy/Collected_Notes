Delay spread is the 'smearing' of a transmitted signal over time.
It is the time domain analogue of frequency selectivity.

If symbol duration is longer than the delay spread, then the [[Communication system|system]] is termed narrowband. If symbol duration is shorter than the delay spread then the system is termed wideband, and can suffer [[inter-symbol interference]] (ISI).
