Concurrency refers to processing that is logically simultaneous. It need not be physically simultaneous (physically separated into different threads on a processor). 

A more abstract definition of concurrency is 'the coordination of multiple parties simultaneously performing computation to achieve a collective task'.

A task that does not require communication between concurrent threads is known as trivially/embarrassingly [[parallel processing|parallelisable]]. 

Communication between threads can be achieved via one of two methods: the [[Shared Memory Model]] or the [[Message Passing Model]]
