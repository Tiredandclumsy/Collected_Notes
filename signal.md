A signal is a physical quantity expressible as a [[function]] of one or more independent features.
For example, a message can be encoded in a signal given by the amplitude of a radio wave over time. This is a one-dimensional signal $A = f(t)$

# Periodic signals
A signal $f(t)$ is periodic if $\exists T \text{ s.t. } \forall t:f(t+T) = f(t)$. The smallest $T$ that satisfies is called the fundamental period $T_0$, and the fundamental frequency is given by $u_0 = \cfrac 1 {T_0}$.
Periodic signals can be expressed as a series of weighted sinusoids with frequencies given by multiples of the fundamental frequency. This decomposition is defined by the [[Fourier transform]].
