Inter-symbol interference refers to transmitted symbols affecting the decoding of subsequent symbols. This is usually caused by [[delay spread|wideband]] systems.

ISI causes irreducible errors, meaning errors that are not affected by [[Signal to Noise Ratio|signal to noise ratio]]. Any system suffering from ISI will therefore plateau to a minimum non-zero [[Error Rate|error rate]] on a [[BER vs SNR curve]] for increasing SNR.
