The standard deviation is a measure on a data set $\sigma : \mathbb R^N : \mathbb R$ representing the spread of data.

When the sample mean is known it is defined$$\sigma = \sqrt{\cfrac 1 {N-1} \sum_{i=1} ^N(x_i - \mu)^2}$$and when the population mean is known it is defined $$\sigma = \sqrt{\cfrac 1 {N} \sum_{i=1} ^N(x_i - \mu)^2}$$
# Variance
Variance is the square of standard deviation: $$\sigma = \cfrac 1 {N-1} \sum_{i=1} ^N(x_i - \mu)^2$$ or $$\sigma = \cfrac 1 {N} \sum_{i=1} ^N(x_i - \mu)^2$$Variance when generalised to two independent dimensions gives [[Covariance|covariance]].
