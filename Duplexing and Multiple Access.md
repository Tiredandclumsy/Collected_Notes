Duplexing refers to any strategy that separates signals originating from two communicating sources. 
Multiple access refers to any scheme that permits multiple different devices to use the same channel, regardless of direction.

Duplexing strategies can be categorised as one of 3 types:
- Simplex - communication flows in one direction only, e.g. radio transmission
- Half Duplex - two way communication, but one direction at a time, e.g. CB radio
- Full Duplex - simultaneous two-way communication, e.g. telephone
