Duplexing refers to any strategy that separates signals originating from two communicating sources. 
Multiple access refers to any scheme that permits multiple different devices to use the same channel, regardless of direction.

Duplexing strategies can be categorised as one of 3 types:
- Simplex - communication flows in one direction only, e.g. radio transmission
- Half Duplex - two way communication, but one direction at a time, e.g. CB radio
- Full Duplex - simultaneous two-way communication, e.g. telephone

The strategies for achieving message separation are:
- Frequency division - Transmitters use different frequency ranges within the bandwidth of the system, e.g. television
- Time division - Transmitters use different time slots assigned within a frame, where the frames repeat cyclically
- Code division - Transmitters use a specific code and algorithm to determine the makeup of their signal. All transmitters use the whole bandwidth simultaneously, and the desired message is extracted from the total received signal by knowledge of the coding algorithm
- Spatial division - The transmitters do not vary their messages at all, and the receiver's knowledge of the spatial environment and location of the transmitters facilitates extraction of the wanted message
