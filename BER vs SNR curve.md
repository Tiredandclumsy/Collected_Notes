The BER vs SNR curve is a useful plot, gained from graphing [[Error Rate |BER]] with a log scale from 1 in decade decrements against [[Signal to Noise Ratio|SNR]] in decibels.

The use of this plot varies based on theory or practice.
A theoretical system would ideally have low BER and low SNR, meaning it has a high power message and high reliability. This means theoretical implementations should occupy the lower left of the chart.
A practical system should be resilient to possibly large amounts of noise and interference, and so should have a low BER for a high SNR, and occupy the lower right of the chart.

A particular curve is yielded from a particular modulation scheme.
