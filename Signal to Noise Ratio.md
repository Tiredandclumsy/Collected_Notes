Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR or less commonly S/R) is is the ratio of signal power to noise power in a communications system. It is usually measured at the [[communication system|receiver]] unless otherwise specified.

A related calculation is $E_b \over N_0$, also referred to as 'SNR per bit', is the normalised SNR measure found via the energy per bit divided by the [[Noise and Interference#Noise Power|noise spectral density]].
